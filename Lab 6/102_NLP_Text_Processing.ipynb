      ">  That choice not only changed his life, it changed our country and, indeed, it even changed the world.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Reverend Graham’s belief in the power of God’s word gave hope to millions and millions who listened to him with his very beautiful but very simple message, God loves you.\n",

      ">  On Wednesday, we will celebrate Billy Graham’s life as he lies in honor in the rotunda of our capital.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  One day, Wednesday until Thursday, about 11:00 on Wednesday, I bet those lines are going to be long and beautiful because he deserves it.\n",
      ">  Not everybody deserves it.\n",
      ">  But very few people, you look back, Ronald Reagan, so honored, very few people are so honored.\n",
      ">  That’s a big thing.\n",

      ">  This senseless act of mass murder shocked our nation and broke our hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  This week, I had the honor of meeting with students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, with families who have lost their children, in prior shootings, great families, great people.\n",

      ">  So full of promise.\n",
      ">  We wish there was something, anything we could do to bring Meadow and all of the others back.\n",
      ">  There are not enough tears in the world to express our sadness and anguish for her family, and for every family that has lost a precious loved one.\n",
      ">  No family should ever have to go in and suffer the way these families have suffered.\n",
      "\n",

      ">  Very sick.\n",
      ">  And we had a lot of warning about him being sick.\n",
      ">  This wasn’t a surprise.\n",
      ">  To the people that knew him, this wasn’t even a little bit.\n",
      ">  In fact, some said we’re surprised it took so long.\n",
      ">  So what are we doing?\n",
      ">  What are we doing?\n",
      "\n",
      ">  We want to ensure that when there are warning signs, we can act and act very quickly.\n",
      ">  Why do we protect our airports and our banks, our government buildings, but not our schools.\n",
      ">  It is time to make our schools a much harder target for attackers.\n",
      ">  We don’t want them in our schools.\n",
      ">  We don’t want them.\n",
      ">  When we declare our schools to be gun-free zones, it just puts our students in far more danger.\n",
      ">  Far more danger.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Well trained, gun adept teachers and coaches and people that work in those buildings, people that were in the Marines for 20 years, and retired, people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, people that are adept, adept with weaponry, and with guns, they teach.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  I mean, I don’t want to have 100 guards standing with rifles all over the school.\n",
      ">  You do a conceal carry permit.\n",
      ">  And this would be a major deterrent, because these people are inherently cowards.\n",
      ">  If they thought like if this guy thought that other people would be shooting bullets back at him, he wouldn’t have gone to that school.\n",
      ">  He wouldn’t have gone there.\n",
      ">  It is a gun-free zone.\n",
      ">  It says this is a gun-free zone.\n",
      ">  Please check your guns way far away.\n",
      ">  And what happens is they feel safe.\n",
      ">  There is nobody going to come at them.\n",
      ">  This way you may have — and, remember, if you use this school as an example, this is a very big school.\n",
      ">  With tremendous floor area and a lot of acreage, a big, big school, good school.\n",
      ">  A big, big school.\n",
      ">  You would have to have 150 real guns.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Look, you had one guard, he didn’t turn out to be too good, I will tell you that.\n",
      ">  He turned out to be not good.\n",
      ">  He was not a credit to law enforcement that I can tell you.\n",
      ">  That I can tell you.\n",
      ">  But as I have been talking about this idea, and I feel it is a great idea, but some people that are good people are opposed to it, don’t like the idea of teachers doing it,\n",
      ">  I’m not talking about teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  CNN went on, they said, Donald Trump wants all teachers, okay, fake news, folks.\n",

      ">  Military people, law enforcement people, they teach.\n",
      ">  They teach.\n",
      ">  And something I thought of this morning, you know what else, I thought of it since I found and watched Peterson, the deputy who didn’t go into the school, because he didn’t want to go into the school, okay.\n",
      ">  He was tested under fire and that wasn’t a good result.\n",
      ">  But you know what I thought of, as soon as I saw that, these teachers, and I’ve seen them, and a lot of schools where they had problems, these teachers love their students and the students love their teachers in many cases.\n",
      ">  These teachers love their students.\n",
      ">  And these teachers are talented with weaponry and with guns.\n",
      ">  And that\n",
      ">  ’s —\n",
      ">  they feel safe.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  And I would rather have somebody that loves their students and wants to protect their students than somebody standing outside that doesn’t know anybody and doesn’t know the students, and frankly for whatever reason decided not to go in even though he heard lots of shots being fired inside.\n",
      ">  The teachers, and the coaches, and other people in the building, the Dean, the Assistant Dean, the Principal, they can — they love their people, they want to protect these kids.\n",
      ">  And I think we’re better with that\n",
      ">  and this may be 10 percent or 20 percent of the population of teachers, et cetera.\n",
      ">  It is not all of them.\n",
      ">  But you would have a lot and you would tell people that they’re inside, and the beauty is it is concealed.\n",
      ">  Nobody would ever see it.\n",
      ">  Unless they needed it.\n",
      ">  It is concealed.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  So this crazy man, who walked in, wouldn’t even know who it is that has it.\n",
      ">  That’s good.\n",
      ">  That’s not bad.\n",
      ">  That’s good.\n",
      ">  And the teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.\n",
      ">  They love their students.\n",
      ">  They love those students, folks.\n",
      ">  Remember that.\n",
      ">  They love their students.\n",
      ">  And I’m telling you that would work because we need offensive capability.\n",
      ">  We can’t just say, it is a gun-free school, we’ll do it a little bit better.\n",
      ">  You say what happens outside.\n",
      ">  The students now leave school, and you got a thousand students, you got 3,500 at the school we’re talking about.\n",
      ">  But you have a thousand students standing outside, the teachers are out there also, if a madman comes along, we have the same problem, but it is outside of the school.\n",
      ">  Or they drive cars.\n",
      ">  There are a lot of things that can happen.\n",
      ">  I want to stop it.\n",

      ">  They love their students.\n",
      ">  They don’t want their students to be killed or to be hurt.\n",
      ">  So we have to do something that works.\n",
      ">  And one of the big measures that we will do and everybody in this room, I think, has to agree, and there is nobody that loves the Second Amendment more than I do, and there is nobody that respects the NRA, the friends of mine, they backed us all, great people, patriots, but great people.\n",
      ">  But we really do have to strengthen up, really strengthen up background checks.\n",

      ">  You know the five great soldiers from three years ago, three of them were world-class marksmen, on a military base in a gun-free zone, asked to check their guns quite far away.\n",

      ">  Do you hate guns?\n",
      ">  It is common sense.\n",
      ">  It is all common sense.\n",
      ">  And some of the strongest advocates about what I’m saying are the strongest advocates, I know them very well, political people, the strongest advocates for the Second Amendment.\n",
